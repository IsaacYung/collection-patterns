# Let's think of a class that takes two open files (a reader and a writer) and encrypts a file.

class Encrypter
  def initialize(key)
    @key = key
  end

  def encrypt(reader, writer)
    key_index = 0
    while not reader.eof?
      clear_char = reader.getc
      encrypted_char = clear_char ^ @key[key_index]
      writer.putc(encrypted_char)
      key_index = (key_index + 1) % @key.size
    end
  end
end

"""
But what happens if the data we want to secure happens to be in a string, rather than in a file? We need an object that looks
like an open file, that is, supports the same interface as the Ruby IO object. We can create an StringIOAdapter to achieve so:
"""

class StringIOAdapter
  def initialize(string)
    @string = string
    @position = 0
  end

  def getc
    if @position >= @string.length
      raise EOFError
    end
    ch = @string[@position]
    @position += 1
    return ch
  end

  def eof?
    return @position >= @string.length
  end
end

# Now we can use a String as if it were an open file (it only implements a small part of the IO interface, essentally what we need).

encrypter = Encrypter.new('XYZZY')
reader= StringIOAdapter.new('We attack at dawn')
writer=File.open('out.txt', 'w')
encrypter.encrypt(reader, writer)
